# SIT09:EMOTIONALSOUNDINGS
SIT09 is the ninth in [Adrian](https://www.instagram.com/adriandcameron)'s series of situations in 2024.

This situation involves taking emotional soundings of the people we encounter a public space (Prospect Park, Brooklyn) at a particular time (Saturday September 28, 2024 from TBD to TBD).

For our purposes, a situation is a rule-based event intended to provoke a creative experience where the outcome is unknown and hopefully surprising. We are inspired by, among others, [Brian Eno's generative work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno#Generative_music).

## The Invitation

We invite members of the public to express an emotion in wordless sound. This emotion may be:
- how they currrently feel.
- prompted by a story card.
- chosen from a menu of emotions based on [Plutchik's wheel of emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik#Plutchik's_wheel_of_emotions).

We record (with explicit consent of the participant) audio of:
- the emotion expressed in isolation.
- the emotion in conversation with an emotion expressed by one of the situation facilitators (situationists? ðŸ˜œ) chosen from the menu:
  - by the particpant.
  - at random.
  - based on a rule (opposite, adjacent, larger, smaller).

## Post-processing
We will use software (perhaps [Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software))) to generate an interactive way to experience the sounds captured. This will allow us to generate choirs of emotion, new conversations, cacophonies, and to discover unanticipated methodologies as we build the experience.
